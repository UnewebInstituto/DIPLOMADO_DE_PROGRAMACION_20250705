Welcome to Python 3.13's help utility! If this is your first time using
Python, you should definitely check out the tutorial at
https://docs.python.org/3.13/tutorial/.

Enter the name of any module, keyword, or topic to get help on writing   
Python programs and using Python modules.  To get a list of available    
modules, keywords, symbols, or topics, enter "modules", "keywords",      
"symbols", or "topics".

Each module also comes with a one-line summary of what it does; to list  
the modules whose name or summary contain a given string such as "spam", 
enter "modules spam".

To quit this help utility and return to the interpreter,
enter "q", "quit" or "exit".

You are now leaving help and returning to the Python interpreter.
If you want to ask for help on a particular object directly from the
interpreter, you can type "help(object)".  Executing "help('string')"    
has the same effect as typing a particular string at the help> prompt.

A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
==========================

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting   
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see https://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands    
as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.   

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for       
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see https://www.cnri.reston.va.us)  
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same   
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became       
Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see     
https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization       
created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.        
Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see https://opensource.org for      
the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python    
Hit Return for more, or q (and Return) to quit: 
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes       
the various releases.

Footnotes:

(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under     
    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute    
    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The     
Hit Return for more, or q (and Return) to quit: 
    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with      
    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.     

(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to        
    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1   
    is "not incompatible" with the GPL.

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's      
direction to make these releases possible.

the code through a linker.

If you further distribute programs that include the Microsoft
Distributable Code, you must comply with the restrictions on
distribution specified by Microsoft. In particular, you must require     
distributors and external end users to agree to terms that protect the   
Microsoft Distributable Code at least as much as Microsoft's own
requirements for the Distributable Code. See Microsoft's documentation   
(included in its developer tools and on its website at microsoft.com)    
for specific details.

platforms; or

- include Microsoft Distributable Code in malicious, deceptive or

These restrictions apply only to the Microsoft Distributable Code as     
defined above, not to Python itself or any programs running on the

      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their        
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)   
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You  
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a        
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work   
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct  
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses      
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
